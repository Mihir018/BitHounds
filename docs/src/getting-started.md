# BitHounds

Welcome to BitHounds!
If you're new and don't know how to start, this is for you.

## What is BitHounds?
A **BitHound** is a digital creature that lives on the Tezos blockchain.
Just like all other lifeforms, hounds can be bred to give birth to newer, more exotic hounds.
You're buy two hounds to start with, and then you can breed them, and their offsprings to give birth to even more hounds.

## How do I get hounds?
A hound lives on the Tezos blockchain.
Every hound is an NFT uniquely owned by you!
Hounds can be bought, traded and sold to other trainers.

## What determines a hound's worth?

Several factors.

Every part of a hound's body has a certain "rarity" assosciated with it.
The rarity of an overall hound is determined by the rarity of it's overall body, and the current phase of the moon. You can read more about moons [here](./moons-and-phases).
